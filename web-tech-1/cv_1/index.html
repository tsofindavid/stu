                        Hello! I'm David, a 2nd-year Applied Informatics student
                        at Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava.
                        Originally from Belarus, I moved to Slovakia to pursue
                        my passion for computer science and software
                        engineering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I enjoy solving technical problems and learning new
                        programming concepts. Currently, I'm working as a
                        Backend Engineer at International Company, where I lead
                        development teams and architect scalable solutions. My
                        experience spans from high-performance web applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my free time, I'm working on my own projects and
                        staying up-to-date with the latest trends in cloud
                        computing and DevOps. I'm particularly interested in
                        distributed systems and how to build applications that
                        can scale to millions of users while maintaining high
                        performance and reliability.
                    </p>

                        When I'm not coding, you can find me reading technical
                        books, experimenting with new frameworks, or working on
                        personal projects that challenge my problem-solving
                        skills. I believe in continuous learning and always
                        strive to improve both my technical abilities and
                        leadership skills. When I'm not coding, you can find me
